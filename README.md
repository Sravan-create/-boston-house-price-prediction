DESCRIPTION:
This repository implements a house price prediction model for the Boston area using Linear Regression. The model predicts the median value of a house based on various features.

Data:

The Boston Housing dataset, containing information about houses in Boston suburbs, is used for training.
Model:

Linear Regression: This is a supervised learning algorithm that establishes a linear relationship between features (e.g., number of rooms) and a target variable (median house price). By fitting a line to the training data, the model can predict prices for new houses.
Implementation:

Load Data: Load the Boston Housing dataset.
Data Exploration: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features and target variable. Identify potential outliers or missing values.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary to improve model performance. This might involve feature scaling or handling categorical variables.
Model Training: Train the Linear Regression model on the prepared data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). R-squared indicates how well the model explains the variance in house prices. Lower MSE signifies better predictions.

CONCLUSION:
This approach leverages Linear Regression to predict house prices in Boston based on various features. By analyzing the model's performance, you can assess its effectiveness and gain insights into factors influencing housing prices.
